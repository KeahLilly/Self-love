    <h1>Why it matters</h1>
    <p>Self love diminishes the idea that happiness is in your next job, next place or next partner, it emphasises that self love starts from within you. The recognition that your happiness stems from the love you have from yourself and is a journey rather than a destination. The uprise of social media, loving yourself has become increasingly difficult. We are repeatedly told how thin, curvy, tanned, tonned, tall, short we should be. That it is near impossible for our real self to achieve. I've always known that loving myself is important, but my journey to self-love is consistently evolving. As I learn new ways to care for myself, be kinder to myself, celebrate my accomplishments and shortfalls. I'm learning to love all of me. This is a page where women can share their journey's to self-love and the expereinces evolving with it.</p>

       <div class="contentblocktext">Self love is important to me because in a world where people are struggling with their identity due to comparing themselves so readily on social media, it's important to be grounded. People will always seek to question their identity and purpose and label you based on your past mistakes. Therefore we must build our identityupon a foundation of self love, knowing that you are worth of and deserve the very best.</div>

  <div class="contentblock" id="contentbox2">
    <div class="overlay">
      <div class="contentblocktext">Some things may be equally essential but nothing is more important than a healthy sense of self-esteem and loving yourself. When you love yourself life becomes simpler and lighter and temporary setbacks affect you far less.</div>

  <div class="contentblock" id="contentbox3">
    <div class="overlay">
      <div class="contentblocktext">Self love to me is when you are a priority in your life, you know your worth, who you're becoming and yet to be. You dedicate time to develop your confidnece, self-esteem and to learn and embrace your imperfections. You understand that seeking approval from others will not make you happy and will not take you far. Self love is truly brining out who you are.</div>

  <div class="contentblock" id="contentbox4">
    <div class="overlay">
      <div class="contentblocktext">To me self love is the most significant relationship you will enage in that will consequently shape every relationship you have with others. It is acknowledging your uniqueness, finding your strengths and taking pride in what akes you feel wholesome and good about yourself. It is also knowing that you are good enough and resisting the pressure to compare yourself to someone you percieve to be happier or more fortunate than you.</div>

  <div class="contentblock" id="contentbox5">
    <div class="overlay">
      <div class="contentblocktext">Self love is from within. When we love ourselves, there is value. You have the best intentions and outlook for yourself. This has helped me with changing my perspective. There's a tendency to look at every flaw within ourselves, induced by society and people with negative outlooks. But I believe when you have self love, it overrides the negativity society may bring and have a positive outlook on love.</div>
